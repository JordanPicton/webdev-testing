         This is a little different from I've been doing things and it seems like it works but I'll have to figure out
         more since the person who I copied this code from didn't really explain it much. So I'd either have to mess
         around with this code myself or just learn more from different sources. Here is the link to the video I
         followed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmFC1e_CUAQ">Click me!</a>

         I removed the old code from this branch to add in this tester to see if I could figure out how this stuff
         works. Though it looks like I'll get that code back again in the fourth navbar test I'm going to do. Other than
         that I've found a few more resources where I can learn about this topic in more detail. Shouldn't be too bad
         hopefully.
