                For this navbar I'll be following a guide from Dani Krossing, which I've followed a guide from before
                and he really helped me understand how certain parts of the Navbar worked. <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/hVw9zvTeYoU">Click here for the guide</a>. This navbar will use little
                JavaScript since people don't like using JavaScript apparently but I don't think I'd mind it too much,
                this is mainly to make the repsonive mobile menu work.

                As of 06/09/2023, I've reset this HTML and CSS document so I can continue to learn about this and not
                get distracted whilst figuring this out and coming back to it a month later. This time I'm completely
                figure out how these pesky things work. (Hopefully)
